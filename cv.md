Key Skills
Over the last two years, I have helped several clients to transition their existing processes to a more flexible, improvement-focused system; for example, I coached several teams at Screwfix in Scrum and other relevant methodologies. I also helped design a course which I then delivered to train the next tranche of internal coaches.
I have spoken at several international conferences on subjects as diverse as Acceptance Test Driven Development, Business Analysis with Feature Injection and Narrative Programming. My focus is on bridging the communication gap that frequently exists between the technical teams and the business.
I am a very capable programmer in C#, most recently with Verivox in Germany where I coached and mentored in both Scrum practices and technical practices. I also have extensive experience in other languages including Java, Javascript and Ruby. I have run workshops on good software design, following SOLID principles, refactoring and writing software in a Behaviour Driven style.
I stay current in my craft by studying online resources, such as blogs and news sites; reading technical books, attending conferences (both as a speaker and participant) and by publishing my own thoughts to gain feedback.
I have a good exposure and understanding of high availability systems; and advanced knowledge of installing, configuring and troubleshooting standard infrastructure applications such as Active Directory, Tivoli, DNS and DHCP (client and server).
Career Highlights
I helped to create and deliver a training course for Agile coaches. For this particular client, this focused on a mix of Scrum practices and XP practices that was suitable for their environment. Co-founding and participating in PairWith.Us, which is still the only unrehearsed, unedited pair- programming screencast that we are aware of. This has inspired similar screencasts (eg. KataCasts, Jim Shore’s Let’s Play TDD), but these often involve an element of rehearsal or skipping over design decisions or research.
I used my in-depth knowledge of the T-Mobile network to provide a last known location for a murder victim’s phone. As a result, her belongings were recovered and an arrest was made.
I created the first revision of a provisioning system that was used by T-Mobile Customer Service Agents to maintain the T-Mobile Equipment Identity Register, the system that disables stolen phones.

￼Career Experience
￼￼￼￼￼RiverGlide Ltd
Lead Consultant
July 2009 to Present
￼￼￼As a consultant with RiverGlide, I have provided coaching to several large clients including BskyB, Kingfisher Group (B&Q, Screwfix) and Verivox GmBH.
Much of this has been centred on transitioning from a successful, but inflexible process to a process that allows for continuous, incremental improvements, leading to greater effectiveness and ability to adapt to a changing environment.
I spent five months in Germany working with Verivox, an energy comparison website. As part of this, I helped to introduce, along with ThoughtWorks, a mixture of Scrum and XP practices. I also included elements from other methodologies such as Kanban and Lean where they were appropriate. I worked closely with their Project Managers, Business Analysts, Developers and Testers. Their system consisted of an ASP.Net frontend, with a C# backend. I coached their developers in good programming practices and helped to implement a transition from some of their older code in .Net 2 to take advantage of some of the new features available in .Net 3.5 and .Net 4
As a consultant at ThoughtWorks, I provided nine months of coaching to one client. This involved mentoring in Scrum practices for project management and XP practices for software development.
I ran workshops on refactoring, software design, BDD and pair programming. I provided one-to-one technical coaching on the same and took the technical lead role for a team. Their development platform is J2EE running on Weblogic.
Prior to this client, I was engaged as a Java developer at a major investment bank. I was involved in taking an existing J2EE application running on JBoss (passing trade details from Front Office GUI clients to the Back Office system) and converting it to a much lighter weight Java application running inside a Tomcat servlet container. I was considered to be the Hibernate expert for the team, as well as providing design guidance and mentoring in the form of pair programming.
As a consultant for Nokia, I was required to provide help desk support to customers of Nokia’s Netact system.
This frequently involved close interaction with the customers to determine the exact nature of the problem experienced.
The NetAct system comprises of many hundreds of interacting processes.
Many of the GUI components of the system have been migrated to Java, and so, often, the first part of the investigation process began with a Java stack trace. This often revealed the issue at hand, such as a file access error (disk full, write permissions, directory doesn't exist), network error (CORBA errors, DNS configuration, firewall issues), or database issues (corrupt records in the database, poor handling of zero query results).
In the majority of cases, I successfully resolved the issues myself. In the case of a software issue, as the support function did not have source code access, I would provide a detailed description of the problem and the likely area in the code that needed to be addressed and pass this information to the developers.
I was a frequent and respected contributor to the internal knowledge base.

￼￼￼￼￼Genesis / Vodafone Australia
Principal System Administrator
November 2004 to May 2006
As OSS System Administrator within Vodafone Australia, I ensured that the OSS System was configured correctly and remained problem free.
This involved being on a 24 hour call out to support both customers of the OSS system within Vodafone and also the Network Management Centre for escalation of faults.
As part of this project, I investigated a Perl script that was causing problems on a partner companies server. At the maximum, it was using over 400MB of memory and taking around an hour to complete. After refactoring, the new script used 2MB and completed in just under 1 minute.
I also wrote a number of auditing scripts to ensure that the levels of access granted to the users of the telecoms elements were appropriate for the job functions.
As a Network Support Engineer, I ensured that the operational network remained fully operational. My department maintained the software on the AXE network and provided second line support of operational faults.
This involved being on a 24 hour call out to support both the Field and Switch Engineers and also the Network Management Centre.
I investigated AXE system restarts (similar to core dumps) and functionality problems and raising associated trouble reports with the Vendors. This involved detailed knowledge of the products used, in particular, using PLEX (proprietary source code) to diagnose faults.
I managed the roll out of software patches as and when they became available in order to maintain a fully functional operational environment.
I conceived and developed a provisioning system for our SEMA EIR and was instrumental in enabling T-Mobile to join with the other UK operators in using the Central EIR (sharing information on stolen mobile phones).
